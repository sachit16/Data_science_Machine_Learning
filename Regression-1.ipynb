    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the underlying data. It's important to check these\n",
    "assumptions to ensure the validity of the regression analysis. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed \n",
    "to be linear. You can check this assumption by plotting the data and examining if the relationship appears roughly \n",
    "linear. Scatter plots of the dependent variable against each independent variable are useful for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence of Residuals: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should\n",
    "be independent of each other. This assumption ensures that there is no pattern in the residuals. You can check this\n",
    "by examining a residual plot, which should show no clear pattern or trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent \n",
    "variables. In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictor\n",
    "variables. A plot of residuals against predicted values can help identify heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of Residuals: The residuals should be normally distributed. This assumption is not crucial for \n",
    "large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem, but for smaller samples, it's important. You can use \n",
    "statistical tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) or visual inspection of a histogram or a Q-Q plot of residuals to assess normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be\n",
    "perfectly correlated. High correlation between independent variables (multicollinearity) can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is commonly used to check for multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check these assumptions, you can perform various diagnostic tests and visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residual plots: Scatter plots of residuals against predicted values or independent variables.\n",
    "- Normality tests: Statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk or visual checks such as Q-Q plots.\n",

    "- VIF values: For multiple linear regression, check VIF values for each independent variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in the training of machine learning models, particularly in training neural networks.
