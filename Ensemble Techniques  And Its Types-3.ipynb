    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling:** It creates multiple bootstrap samples (random subsets with replacement) from the original dataset. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset, introducing diversity and reducing the likelihood of overfitting to specific patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Randomization:** During the training of each decision tree, a random subset of features is considered at each split point. This feature randomization further enhances the diversity among trees and prevents individual trees from becoming too specialized to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Averaging:** The predictions of individual decision trees are aggregated through averaging. This ensemble averaging helps smooth out the noise and errors introduced by individual trees, making the overall model more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n"

    "- **Predictions of Individual Trees:** After training, each decision tree makes a prediction for a given input sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Averaging for Regression:** For regression tasks, the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all individual trees. The average provides a smoother and more stable prediction, reducing the impact of outliers and noise.\n",

    "Q4. **What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?**\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance. Some of the key hyperparameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`n_estimators`:** The number of decision trees in the ensemble. Increasing the number of trees can lead to a more robust model, but it comes with increased computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`max_features`:** The maximum number of features considered for splitting a node. It influences the level of feature randomization. Common choices include \"auto\" (sqrt(n_features)), \"log2\" (log2(n_features)), or an integer (representing the exact number of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`max_depth`:** The maximum depth of each decision tree. Constraining the depth helps control the complexity of individual trees and mitigates overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`min_samples_split`:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. It prevents the creation of nodes that represent too specific patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`min_samples_leaf`:** The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node. It controls the size of the terminal nodes and prevents the creation of very small leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`bootstrap`:** A boolean parameter indicating whether bootstrap samples should be used when building trees. If set to `True`, it enables bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hyperparameters provide control over the behavior of the Random Forest Regressor and can be fine-tuned based on the characteristics of the data and the specific regression task at hand. Grid search or randomized search can be employed to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters through cross-validation."

    "The key differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble vs. Single Tree:** The most significant difference is that the Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method composed of multiple decision trees, while the Decision Tree Regressor consists of a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor. This is because Random Forest builds multiple trees on different subsets of data and averages their predictions, reducing the impact of overfitting present in individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Randomization:** Random Forest Regressor uses feature randomization by considering a random subset of features at each split during tree construction. Decision Tree Regressor considers all features at each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generalization:** Random Forest Regressor generally provides better generalization to unseen data compared to a single Decision Tree Regressor. The ensemble nature of Random Forest helps in capturing diverse patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Complexity:** The model can become complex with a large number of trees, making it less interpretable.\n",
    "2. **Computational Intensity:** Training and predicting with a large number of trees can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "3. **Memory Usage:** The ensemble structure may consume more memory compared to a single decision tree.\n",
